Features:

* Players volume changes with distance to make it sound more realistic.
* Players voice is in 3D (surround)
* Radio communication system
* Teamspeak 3 voice quality
* Auto moving of players into the (password secured) Gspeak channel
* Mouth movement when speaking
* Customizable talk modes with individual icons & ranges

Requirements:

* Teamspeak3 server and a channel containing the letters "Gspeak" in its name
* Clients have to install Gspeak on their devices: http://5.9.67.102/gmod/gspeak/

How does it work?

Each Player receives the distance to any other Player on the server. If the distance is short enough you will slowly start hearing him at the correct position. If now the other player starts talking in Teamspeak3 his mouth will move in the game and an icon appears above his/her head
